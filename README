Flickernoise
============

Flickernoise is the user-friendly VJ application optimized for
the Milkymist One and the Milkymist SoC. It renders hardware-accelerated
visual effects comparable (and, to some extent, compatible) with
those of MilkDrop 1.x, the popular audio visualization plug-in for Winamp.

Flickernoise allows the creation of visual patches and their connection
with all the interfaces that the Milkymist One provides thanks to an easy
to use graphical user interface. Let the visuals react to sound and MIDI
events, connect a camera and create live phantasmagoric images of yourself...
